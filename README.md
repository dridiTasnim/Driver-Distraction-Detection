# Human Activity Recognition: Driver Distraction Detection

Welcome to the Human Activity Recognition project where we explore cutting-edge machine learning techniques to enhance road safety by detecting driver distraction. This project is the result of collaborative work done in a team, with each member contributing their expertise.

## Overview

In our driver activity recognition project, we aimed to develop an effective system for identifying driver distractions using machine learning techniques. We leveraged Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning with TensorFlow to analyze driver behavior and classify activities.

The dataset used for this project was collected for a Computer Vision Competition and serves as a solid foundation for training our models. By employing various machine learning techniques, we achieved an exceptional accuracy of 99.47%.

## Key Features

- Utilized CNNs and Transfer Learning with TensorFlow for analysis.
- Achieved a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.47%.
- Enhanced road safety by detecting driver distractions.

## Collaborative Effort

This project was a collaborative effort, and each team member played a crucial role in its success. I was responsible for some of the data preprocessing and modeling. Our combined skills and dedication made it possible to achieve such impressive results.
